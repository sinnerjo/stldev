        <p>
          STL Soccer Dev Lab exists to give players, coaches, and families in St Louis a clear framework for development.
          It is not a club or academy.
          It is a learning space built around a consistent philosophy and game model.
        </p>

              The project looks beyond this weekend to where a player can be in several years.
              Growth is measured by decisions, habits, and love for the game.

            <div class="card-body">
              While team play matters, individual skill and understanding are the foundation.
              The aim is to build players who can fit into many systems and styles.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Coaching identity behind the lab</h2>
        <p class="section-lead">
          The project reflects a coaching personality that is positive, engaging, and attacking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Training favors the ball, attacking intent, and moments that require players to make choices.
          The coach role is to guide, challenge, and support rather than control every action on the field.
