              When the team wins the ball, the first thought is to move forward and attack with support.
              Players look to break lines, combine, and reach the goal with purpose, while teammates give options around the ball.

              The team defends in a compact block that protects central spaces.
              Lines move together and the gap between defenders and midfielders stays small.

              There is always at least one player pressing the ball carrier.
              Teammates provide cover and balance, ready to step in if the first defender is beaten or if the ball is passed.

            <div class="card-body">
              On winning the ball, the priority is to move forward with support.
              Players recognize space behind or between opponents and look to use it quickly, while keeping enough help near the ball
              to keep the attack alive if the first option closes.

            <div class="card-body">
              When possession is lost, the team gets compact and applies pressure on the new ball carrier immediately.
              This slows the opponent, gives time to recover shape, and can create chances to win the ball back in good areas.

          The game model does not sit on a whiteboard.
          It guides how sessions are built, which scenarios are used in practice, and the language coaches use with players.
          Activities mirror the decisions and pictures players will see on match day.
