      <p class="page-subtitle">
        The work starts with enjoyment, grows through development, and lets winning take care of itself.
        The goal is creative and intelligent players who love the game and want to keep improving.
      </p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Core belief</h2>
        <p>
          The guiding order of priorities is simple  
          enjoyment is greater than development, and development is greater than winning.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">
          Players who enjoy coming to the field stay longer, work harder, and become more creative.
          When the environment is positive and supportive, development speeds up and results follow as a natural outcome.

        <h2 class="section-heading">What we value in players</h2>
        <p class="section-lead">
          Three qualities sit at the center of the approach, in a clear order.

            <div class="card-body">
              Players learn how to see the picture, choose from options, and solve problems.
              The game constantly asks questions.
              Good training lets players practice answering those questions on their own.

              Creativity shows up in dribbling, passing, movement, and solutions in tight spaces.
              Players are encouraged to be brave, try new ideas, and trust that risk taking is welcome.

              Technique supports decisions and creativity.
              Passing, receiving, striking the ball, and first touch are trained so that the player can carry out the ideas they see.

        <h2 class="section-heading">How we treat mistakes</h2>
        <p>
          Mistakes are part of long term learning.
          A poor choice is not a real mistake until it is repeated without any change or reflection.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">
          Players are allowed to fail today in order to grow tomorrow.
          The focus is on what the player saw, what they tried to do, and what they might try next time.

          Success does not start with trophies or league tables.

            <div class="card-body">
              The main target is a player who chooses to keep playing, practicing, and watching the game because they enjoy it.
              When players own their love for soccer, they push themselves further.

              By the end of U15, players should be in a position to step into high school soccer and beyond with confidence,
              understanding their strengths and what they want to improve next.
