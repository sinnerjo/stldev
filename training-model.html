        How sessions are built to match the philosophy and game model.
        The structure is repeatable, flexible, and focused on decision making, creativity, and technical quality for U15 and younger.

        <p class="section-lead">
          Most sessions follow a clear rhythm so players know what to expect while still feeling challenged and creative.

            <div class="card-title">Arrival activity</div>
            <div class="card-body">
              Players start working as soon as they step onto the field using small sided games (2v2, 3v3, ...)
              We start (and end) with the player's favorite part of every training session... play.
              It sets a positive and engaging tone for the entire training.

            <div class="card-title">Non-Game Form</div>
            <div class="card-body">
              Non-game form activities isolate a specific idea or technical action without the full pressure of a game. These can include footskills, first touch, shooting, passing where the technique is applied outside of an activity or game. They give players clear repetitions that support the decisions they’ll make later in the session.

            <div class="card-body">
              The main activity stretches the picture into a larger space, more game like situation that requires not only technical expertise but decision making as well.
              Here, the idea is tied directly to the game model, such as finishing from a through pass or attacking out of a transition.

            <div class="card-body">
              Sessions end with a game that looks like match play. This give the players the opportunity to try out their lesson in the day's activity in a realistic game setting.

              Activities are chosen because they force decisions.
              Players work out when to pass, dribble, or shoot instead of repeating pre set patterns.
              The coach helps them see options instead of giving every answer.

              Players are encouraged to try new solutions, even if they fail at first.
              Mistakes are treated as normal parts of training.
              A poor choice only becomes a problem if it repeats with no learning.

              Most technical training is built into game like situations instead of isolated drills.

              Arrival activity with simple passing patterns, a rondo to work on angles, and a main game where midfielders play forwards in behind.

              Games begin with recovering the ball and moving forward quickly with support.
              Coaching points include first pass after winning the ball, movement of the nearest teammates, and choices in the final third.
